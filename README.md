# Qbook (QR Code Based Appointment System)

QBook is designed for out-patient(OP) consultation at clinics. The app automates the queuing process between the doctor and the patients who are waiting for consultation. 
During the tough times of COVID-19 pandemic, it's essential to maintain social distance and high safety standards. Inorder to overcome this challenge, we have designed an app where a patient can scan the QR code and book an appointment without the need to touch anything.

Easy and hassle free booking system is provided where the user can easily authenticate using the mobile number with OTP verification and pay the required consultation fees online.The queue number will be displayed immediately in the confirmation page once the booking has been completed.
